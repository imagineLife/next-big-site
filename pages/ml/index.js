      <h2>Machine Learning</h2>
      <p>
        Machine Learning is a sub-category of &quot;artificial
        intelligence&quot;. Machine learning is focused on algorithms, data,
        training &quot;models&quot; & testing &quot;models&quot;. One primary
        &quot;end-to-end&quot; goal of machine learning is to teach a machine
        how to predict accurate results based on some given input, like
        detecting a person &/or object in a video.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Artificial Intelligence</b> might take machine learning output and
        apply the result to more comprehensive system. Photos and computer might
        be used to teach a machine to learn to identify items in the photos.
        Artificial Intelligence might take the predicted results from the
        machine and <i>integrate with other systems</i> based on the machine
        learning output: connect the model to a camera and video feed data, and
        perform &quot;real time&quot; analysis of objects in videos. Artificial
        Intelligence systems might be comprised of things like machine learning,
        computer vision, natural language processing, etc.
