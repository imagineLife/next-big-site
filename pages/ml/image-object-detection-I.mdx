# Building An Object Image Detector
## Goals
As a User, I can upload an image and see a detected image in one-word.   

### Tech Involved
- [tensorflowJS](https://www.tensorflow.org/js) (_one of my personal primary motivators here_), for machine learning
- [react](https://react.dev/) for UI component-ization
- [nextjs](https://nextjs.org/) for encapsulating server-side rendering, project architecture, and a "batteries-included" dev setup
- markdown, git, && toying with mdx
- [coco-ssd](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/coco-ssd), a pre-built machine learning model that can detect objects in images (_80 classes of objects_)
- [FileReader browser API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FileReader)
